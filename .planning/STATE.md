## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1-4]: Roadmap sequence set to intake -> cleanup/review -> interior export -> batch packaging.
- [Phase 2]: Cleanup requires deterministic preprocessing plus AI-assisted correction with user approval gate.
- [Phase 3]: KDP compliance checks (trim, gutter, embedded fonts) treated as mandatory release gate.

### Pending Todos
