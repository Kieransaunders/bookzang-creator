# BookZang - Internal Content Production Tool

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: BookZang is an **internal tool**, not a SaaS product. It is a content production pipeline for processing public domain books (primarily from Project Gutenberg) into various publishable formats.

## What It Does

1. **Imports** public domain books from Project Gutenberg or file uploads
2. **Cleans** them (strips Gutenberg headers/footers, normalizes formatting)
3. **Exports** formatted PDFs with professional templates
4. **Tracks** jobs and manages a library of processed content
