## Leadership Lessons

1. **Survival Requires Worthiness** — Merely existing isn't enough; one must demonstrate the values worth surviving for.

2. **Trust Is a Choice** — You never truly know if someone is trustworthy until you take the risk.

3. **Unity Is Strength** — Division among allies is often more dangerous than external enemies.

4. **Accountability Matters** — You cannot create something and then abandon responsibility for it.

5. **Know When to Fight** — Running forever is not a strategy; sometimes you must turn and face the threat.

6. **Separate Powers** — Military and civilian authority serve different purposes; blurring them threatens liberty.

7. **Take Calculated Risks** — "Rolling the hard six" means accepting high risk when the potential reward justifies it.
